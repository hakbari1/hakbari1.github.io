## academic integrity is something that should be important for everyone including professors and students, there are amny reasons for that, but some are as follow:

- the only reason that everyone should be attending college or school is to learn something, you can do the copy paste anytime you want from google.
- it makes every students to present thier own works without copy pasting that will make the students be innovative and productive.
